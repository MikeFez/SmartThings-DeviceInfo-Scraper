# SmartThings-DeviceInfo-Scraper

Proof of concept, this script allows for device data extraction without API access by scraping the SmartThings dev panel.

Example use cases: 
1. Log data to spreadsheets on a regular frequency
2. Monitor battery levels of devices without use of the mobile app
3. Perform actions based on the current status of devices

Please note that as this is not based upon the SmartThings API, changing of the website most likely will break this script.
